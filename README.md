## Dependencies
Most of the core modules can be compiled without additional libraries. 

That said, you'll need the following dependencies installed if you want all the modules to compile:
- libpcre (install from your package manager) 
- allegro5 (https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5) (install from your package manager)
- cjson (https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) (included in submodules as we only need to get the .h and .c  from it)
- librdkafka (https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka)  (included in submodules as the system version may be too old in a lots of cases)
- nuklear (https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) (included in submodules WIP dialog manager, not used ATM, header only library)
